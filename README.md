**Disclaimer**

CORS is turned off on the API server for testing purposes
Missing a lot of styling efforts

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# start api server at localhost:3333
$ yarn api

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
